# SEVENGINE

## Coding Standards

### Coding Style

Class, method, function, and other such entities are named with pascal case.

Variable names are named with camel case.

Curly braces on a new line.

`private` before `protected` before `public`; match order in source files.

Tabs for spaces, except when matching indentation.

```cpp
void Foo(u64 arg)
{
	Bar(arg,
	    true,
	    nullptr);
}
```

### Best Practices

Use define blocks instead of `#pragma once` for header guards.

```cpp
#ifndef HEADER_NAME_H_
#define HEADER_NAME_H_

// Header file contents

#endif
```

Use constructor initializater lists.

```cpp
MyClass::MyClass(u64 arg) :
	memberVariable(arg)
{
	// Possibly do something here
}
```

Use `const` and `inline` where applicable.

```cpp
inline u64 GetVar() const { return memberVariable; }
```

Limit includes as much as possible.

### Engine Preferences

Use the fixed-size numeric types defined in `types.h`.

Do not perform raw IO outside of specifically designated engine subsystems.

We will be maintaining a Linux build, with full intention of this engine supporting cross-platform development. Don't break this with platform-specific code.

## Setting Up the Project

### GLM

When including glm in a file, ensure that you `#define GLM_ENABLE_EXPERIMENTAL` before the GLM includes. The basic 3D maths GLM include section would look like :

```cpp
#define GLM_ENABLE_EXPERIMENTAL
#include "../glm/glm.hpp"
#include "../glm/gtx/quaternion.hpp"
```

### GLEW

The OpenGL Extension Wrangler Library is useful for determining the level of OpenGL functionality that the target platform supports. The following guide will help enable it in your environment:

1. Download GLEW at : https://sourceforge.net/projects/glew/files/glew/2.1.0/glew-2.1.0-win32.zip/download

2. After extracting all files, move the `GL` folder located in `glew-2.1.0\include` to your project's `include` directory

3. Copy the library files in `glew-2.1.0\lib\Release\x64` to your project's `libraries` directory

4. (Visual Studio) Go to your project properties, and set Configuration and Platform options to All

5. (Visual Studio) Go to C/C++ -> General. Add `$(ProjectDir)include` to `Additional Include Directories` if it is not already there

6. (Visual Studio) Go to Linker -> General. Add `$(ProjectDir)libraries` to `Additional Library Directories` if it is not already there

7. (Visual Studio) Go to Linker -> Input. Add `glew32s.lib` to `Additional Dependencies`

8. (Visual Studio) Go to C/C++ -> Preprocessor. Add `GLEW_STATIC` to `Preprocessor Definitions`

### GLFW

The Graphics Library Framework is useful for assisting in simple window creation and input handling. The following guide will help enable it in your environment:

1. Download GLEW at : https://www.glfw.org/download.html

2. After extracting all files, move the `GLFW` folder to your project's `include` directory

3. Copy the library files in `lib-vc2015` to your project's `libraries` directory

4. (Visual Studio) Go to your project properties, and set Configuration and Platform options to All

5. (Visual Studio) Go to C/C++ -> General. Add `$(ProjectDir)include` to `Additional Include Directories` if it is not already there

6. (Visual Studio) Go to Linker -> General. Add `$(ProjectDir)libraries` to `Additional Library Directories` if it is not already there

7. (Visual Studio) Go to Linker -> Input. Add `glfw3.lib` to `Additional Dependencies`

### Boost

_Note : this guide is primarily targeted at setting up a Windows development environment. You can probably just use your package manager on Linux._

1. Download boost at : https://www.boost.org/users/history/version_1_69_0.html

2. Extract into the `Engine` project directory

3. Run `bootstrap.bat` or `bootstrap.sh` depending on your development environment

4. Run the newly generated `b2` executable (this will take a while)

5. (Visual Studio) Go to your project properties, and set Configuration and Platform options to All

6. (Visual Studio) Add `$(ProjectDir)Engine\boost_1_69_0` to `Include Directories`

7. (Visual Studio) Add `$(ProjectDir)Engine\boost_1_69_0\stage\lib` to `Library Directories`

### LuaJIT

_Note : this guide is primarily targeted at setting up a Windows development environment. You can probably just use your package manager on Linux._

1. Download and extract the LuaJIT zip file from the Team Drive

2. Copy the `lua51.lib` and `lua51.dll` files from the `src` directory into your project `libraries` directory and build location

3. Copy the entire `src` directory into your project `includes` directory, and rename it to `luajit-2.0`

4. Add `lua51.lib` to your project's linked library settings
